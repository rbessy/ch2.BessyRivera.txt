Output
ORA-02291: integrity constraint (SQL_CVOAWSYHPWKOCDHGOLVLKAJWQ.ORDERS_CUSTOMER#_FK) violated - parent key not found ORA-06512: at "SYS.DBMS_SQL", line 1721

The error is that A foreign key value has no matching primary key value.
What cause the error is that there is no customer in the customers tablet meaning that there is no customer# and neither a primary key for the customer# so we cannot put a customer# in the orders tablet that does not exist and does not have a primary key to match the foreign key.

Output
ORA-01400: cannot insert NULL into ("SQL_CVOAWSYHPWKOCDHGOLVLKAJWQ"."ORDERS"."ORDERDATE") ORA-06512: at "SYS.DBMS_SQL", line 1721

The error is that we cannot insert NULL value to ORDERDATE.
What cause the error is the orderdate column has a NOT NULL constraint.
